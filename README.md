## Project Overview
This project blends machine learning with fintech, aiming to build a smart system that helps detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time. It’s all about helping financial institutions and fintech apps make faster, better decisions to protect users.

- Build a machine learning model that flags fraudulent transactions.
- Use SQL or Spark to pull and process transaction data.
- Clean, normalize, and prep the data to ensure solid model training.
- Continuously improve the model by testing and tuning.
- Document the full process in a professional GitHub repository.

---
## Model Development Overview:
- Write a Python script to train, test, and make predictions with our model.
- Clean and normalize numeric fields, encode categorical variables.
- Query the dataset using SQL or Spark to explore and filter data (e.g., flag high-value transactions).
- Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Datasets
1.	PaySim: Simulated mobile money transaction data with fraud labels (MIT License).
2.	BankSim: Simulated banking behaviors and anomalies.
3.	Synthetic Option: If needed, we can generate realistic transactions using Faker and SDV, including fields like amount, merchant, location, time, and fraud label.

## Timeline (Due April 21, 2025):
- Apr 7-9: Get the data, explore it, and set up SQL or Spark.
- Apr 10-12: Clean, normalize, and engineer features.
- Apr 13–15: Train a baseline model and evaluate initial results.
- Apr 16–17: Tune hyperparameters and optimize performance.
- Apr 17–18: Finalize evaluation, clean up documentation and GitHub.
- Apr 19–20: Prepare and rehearse the final presentation.
- Apr 21: Final presentation and submission.

---
## Expected Outcome:
- A fraud detection model with strong performance (at least 75% accuracy or 0.80+ AUC).
- A well-documented modeling process with visible iteration.
- A polished, professional GitHub repo.
- A confident and informative group presentation that shows a solid grasp of fraud detection in fintech.
